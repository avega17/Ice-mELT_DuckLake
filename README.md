# Ice-m<sup>3</sup>ELT DuckLake

Modern data lakehouse pipeline for Earth Observation (EO) photovoltaic (PV) solar panel segmentation and energy forecasting, built on open-source and cloud-native technologies. This work is developed as part of the methodology for my Computer Science master's thesis at [UPR, R√≠o Piedras](https://natsci.uprrp.edu/ccom/masters/). 

## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive data pipeline for processing and analyzing global photovoltaic installation datasets, combining:
- **Vector data**: PV installation polygon and point coordinates from multiple DOI open-access datasets
- **Raster data**: Satellite multispectral imagery and irradiance data via public STAC catalogs
- **Analytical processing**: Spatial indexing, administrative boundary enrichment, and energy forecasting

### Project Name Explained

**ice-mELT DuckLake** reflects our modern data architecture approach:

- **Ice**: Leverages *Iceberg-inspired* open table formats and **Icechunk** [tensor storage engine](https://earthmover.io/blog/icechunk-1-0-production-grade-cloud-native-array-storage-is-here)
- **m<sup>3</sup>ELT**: **Modern** and **Multi-Modal** data stack with **Extract-Load-Transform** pipelines ([dbt methodology](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/extract-load-transform))
- **DuckLake**: Data lakehouse architecture using the new **DuckLake** [open table and lakehouse format](https://ducklake.select/faq#what-is-ducklake) for SQL-based metadata management (see [the file explosion problem](https://www.starburst.io/blog/apache-iceberg-files/))

### Core Technologies and Spatio-Temporal Data

**Storage & Formats**
- **Local filesystem** and **S3-compatible buckets** for data storage
- **Zarr** data format with **Icechunk** tensor storage engine for rasters
- **VirtualiZarr** for virtual datasets referencing original imagery from STAC assets
- **Apache (Geo)Parquet** for lakehouse tables and vector data where GeoParquet adds native support for spatial geometry types like points, lines, and polygons
- **Apache (Geo)Arrow**, an [in-memory columnar format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/Intro.html) that enables [zero-copy shared memory](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/Columnar.html) and [RPC-based data movement](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/Flight.html) between processes and networked services. The [GeoArrow specification](https://geoarrow.org/format.html#motivation) simply codifies conventions for "representing spatial data in Apache Arrow formats (e.g., C Data Interface, Serialized IPC) and implementations (e.g., PyArrow, Arrow C++, arrow-rs)".
- **COG/GeoTIFF/NetCDF** for underlying imagery and raster assets accessed via Zarr stores


**Transform & Processing**
- [Apache Hamilton DAGs](https://github.com/apache/hamilton) for composable, self-documenting dataflows and pipelines
- [dbt core](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core?tab=readme-ov-file) and [dbt-duckdb adapter](https://duckdb.org/2025/04/04/dbt-duckdb.html) for Python **AND** SQL data model development, lineage, docs, and testing
- [Ibis](https://ibis-project.org/why) Python dataframe API compiles and executes on any (supported) SQL query engine
- [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/latest/getting-started-guide/why-xarray.html) for labeled multi-dimensional arrays and API for accessing Zarr stores
- [Google Tensorstore](https://google.github.io/tensorstore/) for performant reading/writing of large ND-arrays

**Query Engines**
- **Unified OLTP Catalog**: Unified [Neon PostgreSQL](https://neon.com/docs/get-started-with-neon/why-neon) catalog for DuckLake metadata
- **OLAP Embedded Query Engine**: DuckDB (local development) + MotherDuck (cloud scaling) 
- **Production**: Neon PostgreSQL with connection pooling and multi-user concurrency
- **Development**: Neon Local container proxy with ephemeral branching from production snapshots for safe experimentation and testing changes 

**Data Lakehouse & Catalogs**
- **DuckLake** - Open lakehouse format with SQL catalog for all metadata management
- **Apache Iceberg** open table format for ACID transactions (can be complementary to DuckLake and definitely has wider adoption)
- **STAC** (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog) for satellite imagery metadata and asset discovery
- [H3 spatial indexing](https://h3geo.org/docs/highlights/indexing) for efficient spatial aggregations and operations while limiting data volume to hierarchical Areas-of-Interest

**Data Sources**
- DOI datasets via [datahugger](https://github.com/J535D165/datahugger/tree/main)
- [STAC assets](data_loaders/stac_manifest.json) for satellite imagery
- [Overture Maps](https://overturemaps.org/blog/2025/overture-maps-foundation-making-open-data-the-winning-choice/) for admin boundaries, building footprints, land cover
- [Google Solar API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/solar/data-layers) and [NREL NSRDB](https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/about/what-is-the-nsrdb) for irradiance data

### ü¶Ü **Why DuckLake? A Key Architectural Decision**

**DuckLake** addresses fundamental limitations in existing lakehouse formats by storing metadata in a transactional SQL database rather than as "many small files" in object storage. This enables single-query metadata access, reliable ACID transactions, and seamless integration with existing tools and decades of DBMS advances since at it's core it simply **builds on SQL and Parquet**. A key DuckLake contribution to the data lakehouse architecture is is adding another dimmension to scale: Storage, compute, AND metadata can all scale independently.

> *DuckLake re-imagines what a ‚ÄúLakehouse‚Äù format should look like by acknowledging two simple truths:*  
> *1. Storing data files in open formats on blob storage is a great idea for scalability and to prevent [cloud and data vendor] lock-in.*  
> *2. Managing metadata is a complex and interconnected data management task best left to a database management system.*  

-- [The DuckLake Manifesto: SQL as a Lakehouse Format](https://ducklake.select/manifesto/#ducklake)

#### Key Benefits for EO Research:
- **Fast metadata access** for spatial workloads
- **Reliable cross-table transactions** for multi-dataset integration
- **Collaborative research** with consistent concurrent access
- **Cost-effective scaling** using free tier PostgreSQL for metadata

### üîÑ **Hamilton Dataflows: The Modern Pipeline Approach**

Our pipeline architecture leverages **Hamilton** for function-based DAG dataflows that provide:

**Key Benefits:**
- **Lineage as Code**: Dependencies encoded directly in function signatures
- **Self-Documentation**: Pipeline structure is immediately visible and understandable
- **Composable Design**: Functions can be reused across different execution contexts
- **Built-in Caching**: Intelligent caching with automatic invalidation
- **Parallel Execution**: Native support for parallel processing with dependency management

**Design Philosophy**: Following the "Big Data is Dead" approach, our Hamilton dataflows are optimized for **medium data** workloads that fit comfortably on modern single-node systems while providing sophisticated analysis capabilities without distributed computing complexity.

## üîß Configuration

### Unified Architecture Strategy

Our architecture provides seamless development-to-production workflows with cost-effective scaling:

**Development Environment (Neon Local + Local DuckDB)**
- **Neon Local**: Ephemeral or Persisting DB branches from production schema and data (free)
- **DuckDB**: Local analytical processing with full spatial extensions (free)
- **Local storage**: Development data materialization for fast iteration (free)
- **Docker**: Containerized Neon Local proxy with automatic branch cleanup (free)

**Production Environment (Neon Cloud + MotherDuck + R2)**
- **Neon PostgreSQL**: Serverless catalog with connection pooling (0.5GB free tier)
- **MotherDuck**: Hybrid query processing with intelligent local/cloud routing (10GB free tier)
- **Cloudflare R2**: Zero-egress object storage for data lakehouse (10GB free tier)
- **Same dbt models**: Identical transformations beyond environment configuration

**Key Benefits**:
- **Environment parity**: Same catalog structure, same models, same data
- **Safe experimentation**: Ephemeral branches prevent production impact
- **Cost optimization**: Free tiers for research, pay-as-you-scale for production
- **Hybrid processing**: Intelligent query routing between local and cloud compute for some production workloads

**Cost Projection**: Some academic research workloads operate entirely within free tiers (~$0/month), production scales cost-effectively (~$10's/month for certain TB-scale datasets).
