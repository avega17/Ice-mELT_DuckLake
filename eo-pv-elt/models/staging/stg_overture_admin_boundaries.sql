-- Staging model for Overture Maps administrative boundaries
-- Optimized for DuckDB 1.3.0 SPATIAL_JOIN operator with H3 spatial filtering
-- 
-- This model:
-- 1. Creates H3 grid from existing PV locations at resolution 6 (coarse, ~36kmÂ²)
-- 2. Queries Overture Maps S3 data directly with bbox pre-filtering
-- 3. Uses SPATIAL_JOIN operator for 100x performance improvement
-- 4. Filters to admin levels relevant for PV analysis
-- 5. Materializes as incremental table for efficient updates
